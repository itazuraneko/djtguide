<p><h2>Learning Resources</h2></p>

<span id="Kana"></span>

<p><h3>Kana</h3></p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="http://unckel.de/kanateacher/index-en.html">Kana Teacher</a> - Tests kana recognition. The recommended procedure for learning kana. Just grind until you know them. Does not teach stroke order or pronunciation. Optimal for pounding the readings into your head quickly.</p>

<p><a href="anki.html">Anki</a> - <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/722065315">Hiragana deck</a>.  Katakana and Hiragana deck: See Anki section of the first sheet in the <a href="cor.html">Cornucopia of Resources</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Hiragana/Lesson_1">Wikibooks</a> - Has stroke order and other resources. The stroke order is quite useful, although the mnemonics are not so much.</p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/writing">Tae Kim</a> - This site has a ton on kana, includes a video lesson, stroke order, as well as a pronunciation guide.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a> - Offers various SRS courses including kana courses which are perhaps the only thing the site does well in regards to the Japanese language. If Kana Teacher isn’t cutting it, give this a whirl. Way better than just attempting to remember them. By all means, use Kana Teacher.</p>

<p><a href="https://mega.nz/#F!Wk8VjJ6K!icqt2OiW4Vhle7q4cGUf_Q">Remembering the Kana</a> - It only takes about 6 hours to learn both hiragana and katakana alongside it because it provides mental images with the kana to ensure you remember. Download the book and/or follow this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2A25F7399E8805ED">video series</a> made by an RTK forum member.</p>

<span id="Kanji"></span>

<p><h3>Kanji</h3></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi">Remembering the Kanji</a> (RTK) by Heisig - A book that teaches kanji in an order based on the radicals of each character. It starts you off with simple shapes and gradually goes into more complex ones. It teaches stroke order and makes up pretty fancy mnemonic stories to help you memorize the kanji easier. It does not teach the readings until the second volume nor does it tell you how the kanji are used in context. (Most people do not use the second volume and instead learn readings through vocabulary.) As such, this method expects you to learn all the common characters before even getting started on learning vocabulary. Of course, you can still start learning vocabulary while doing Heisig.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/">Koohii</a> is a fansite that provides pre-made stories for RTK, generally superior to the ones in the book. (Note that some people find that creating their own mnemonic story can form stronger associations than trying to memorize someone else’s.) You can access these stories more conveniently from <a href="https://hochanh.github.io/rtk/">this interface</a>. Do not use the spaced-repetition-system on Koohii; Anki is superior. There is an Anki deck in the <a href="cor.html">Cornucopia of Resources</a>. You’ll also need to follow alongside the book PDF, since the deck does not teach the “primitive” kanji components.</li>
<li>Read more about it from <a href="http://rtkwiki.koohii.com/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji">Koohii wiki</a> or <a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/blog/2008/01/31/final-thoughts-on-remembering-the-kanji/">Tae Kim</a>. <a href="https://nihongoshark.com/learn-kanji/">Here</a> is a detailed post about the mnemonic system, its advantages, and how to apply it, as well as how to incorporate Anki into it for added effectiveness (note: while this guy recommends using the kanji on the front of the card in Anki on the basis that it is easier, Heisig says, in all caps no less, in his book that <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bosAK1q.png">reviewing should only ever be done from the keyword</a>; the RTK deck in the Cornucopia of Resources has the keyword on the front of the cards, but is otherwise identical to the deck recommended on that page).</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.kanjidamage.com/">KanjiDamage</a> - Another kanji resource that uses a radical-based order. Unlike Heisig’s method it also teaches the readings and gives you examples of common words that use those kanji (great for adding them to your Anki deck right away). Take the introduction on the site with a grain of salt, as it isn’t very accurate, or is just plain wrong, as is the case with some other areas on the site, but that in no way makes this a bad resource in regards to learning. You may want to simply use the shared deck for Anki (see <a href="cor.html">Cornucopia of Resources</a>) instead of the website in tandem with another vocabulary deck in order to build up a big cache of words quickly.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mega.co.nz#!CQg0SKyI!Ufho0RKmmW8P6XRx8KiDY1JeAXoGOgmjrEscayil8cA">KanjiDamage+ (Anki deck)</a> The deck was created to solve some of the problems with KanjiDamage - namely the often criticized style of mnemonics. They're still there but often toned down or changed to something more logical/less crude. Some mistakes are fixed. Furthermore, the kanji base got significantly expanded, now the deck has 2136 cards (~1900 kanji, rest are radicals).  The deck can be browsed online <a href="http://kanjidamageplus.neocities.org/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Diku_kanji">Kyouiku</a> - A subset of 1006 of the jouyou kanji that is taught in primary school. Has many simple words in the beginning (the numbers, elements of nature, body parts). Usually ordered by grade. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.genetickanji.com/">GeneticKanji</a> - Slightly undeveloped alternative to the liberal ranting, poor jokery and the downright misinformation in KanjiDamage. It is presented in a fashion of frequency while covering the individual elements that make up a given kanji. In GeneticKanji’s approach, you would be taught all the subcomponents of these common kanji, and then the common kanji themselves, effectively combining both approaches.</p>

<p><a href="https://mega.nz/#!ncYFXTyJ!KXwmhJu4QogtPasf0wt_zxyGvIfnm4gXxKsmdIv51sQ">The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course</a> - A book that uses a similar mnemonic approach to RTK, but also includes vocabulary and readings. Each entry includes 4 or 5 vocabulary words  to illustrate the kanji's meanings and readings. These words consist only of previously learned kanji. Use it with an Anki deck such as <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/779483253">this one</a> .</p>

<p><a href="https://mega.nz/#!uJsA1QwR!2z65jNf9lagIjvESUHHE-mMT3EXjfbRiBo91F9RpQwU">Kangxi Radicals</a> - An Anki deck with more accurate meanings for the radicals than other available resources. Comes with only recognition-style cards (radical on the front, meaning on the back) by default, though it would be easy to change the layout yourself and have the meaning on the front and the radical on the back instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1044119361">Kanji Radical (Primitive)</a> - Contains all 214 radicals, their alternative forms (which may be used more often or even exclusively instead of the 'proper' form), their meaning (which is sometimes related to the kanji they appear in) and their Japanese readings  (which there isn't really any point in learning). Compared to the deck above, this has more information but may be less accurate.  <a href="http://pastebin.com/KibfAzNw">Has both recognition and recall cards</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>You may wish to use <a href="http://pastebin.com/gzKyJXqr">this</a> customised layout which adds a mincho/serif font to the cards so you can see how the radicals look in that typeface. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For rote kanji study</strong>: Just pick whichever mnemonic deck (RTK/KKLC/KD) takes your fancy and edit the card layout to remove the mnemonics if necessary. The reason for this is that the mnemonic decks give much more concise meanings for the kanji, whereas rote decks often have <a href="https://my.mixtape.moe/lohfho.png">far too many meanings</a> to be realistically remembered for each kanji. It's worth doing <a href="https://mega.nz/#!uJsA1QwR!2z65jNf9lagIjvESUHHE-mMT3EXjfbRiBo91F9RpQwU">a radical deck</a> first so that if you encounter any kanji which you're really struggling to remember through rote, you can make up a mnemonic using the radicals.</p>

<span id="Vocabulary"></span>

<p><h3>Vocabulary</h3></p>

<p><span class="bold">Anki Shared Decks</span> - This is highly recommended to learn vocabulary. Obviously, you will need <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> to use it. There are decks, you may search for them and see which one will best suit your needs. The most commonly recommended vocabulary deck is <a href="anki.html">Core 2k/6k</a>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="http://rikaisama.sourceforge.net/#realtime_import_help">Rikaisama's Anki Real-Time Import Feature</a> - An invaluable tool for creating a mining deck. Allows you to automatically create cards in Anki simply by hovering over a word and pressing "r". <a href="anki.html#import">Here</a> is an explanation of how to set it up. </p>

<span id="Grammar"></span>

<p><h3>Grammar</h3></p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar">Tae Kim</a> - This is the most commonly used guide on DJT because it is faster than the others listed here. Use the grammar guide, not the “complete guide” (which is incomplete). Tae Kim only has exercises in the beginning, after which there are no exercises to work on.</p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="https://mega.co.nz#!6hlnVAYI!UFFH7L5QCW3Lm09nri0NqKh3z76F-v-ETxLjEx_PczE">Japanese the Manga Way</a> - This book teaches grammar through examples from actual Japanese manga, breaking down each sentence into its components to explain the meaning. It covers most of the same material as Tae Kim with less technical language, and will teach you enough grammar to begin reading. </p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="https://mega.co.nz#F!m5tU0QxJ!ML2OBq3waLUHrWg9HiWeSA">Dictionaries of Japanese Grammar (DOJG)</a> - A collection of three books, Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. As the name implies, these are dictionaries rather than guides. It goes in-depth into the various grammar rules, more so than virtually any other resource.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is an index of the DOJG <a href="http://core6000.neocities.org/dojg/">here</a> with notes, example sentences and formation tables.</li>
<li>There is also a <a href="http://dojgdeck.neocities.org/">DOJG Anki deck</a>. Those in favour of it suggest that it is a good way of exposing yourself to all the entries in the DOJG books and periodically reviewing them.
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/w0gRFM0c">Genki</a> - Genki tends to be more comprehensive than Tae Kim, and it has exercises that you can practice. This works as an engaging way to learn new grammar points, which may help drill grammar rules into your mind. The obvious downside is speed, of course. This resource can be found on the bottom of the pastebin.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/c6219m4xxxixj0x/Genki+1+%28Anon+edit%29.zip">Genki 1</a> - An edited version of Genki 1 with the distracting romaji edited out can be found here. This version is preferred over the one in the pastebin as it encourages the learning of kana.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www2.gwu.edu/~eall/vjgnew/vjghomepage/vjghome.htm">Visualizing Japanese Grammar</a> - A series of videos that lucidly explain the basics of Japanese grammar. Each grammar concept has a quiz to test your understanding. The videos can also be downloaded from the <a href="cor.html">CoR</a> .</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imabi.net/">Imabi</a> - Written by a guy with a linguistics degree. More factually accurate and comprehensive than Tae Kim's guide, but its length and abundant use of linguistics terminology may make it unsuitable for complete beginners and/or people who would like to just quickly get basic grammar down and move onto reading. Those who plan on doing <a href="anki.html">Core2K</a> before they start reading, however, should have ample time (~3 months) to get through it before they finish that deck. While it has some flaws as a beginner’s guide, it can be very useful as a reference resource, especially for things which aren't covered in Tae Kim's guide.</p>

<p><a href="http://pomax.github.io/nrGrammar/">An introduction to Japanese - Syntax, Grammar & Language</a> - There are many words in each chapter (six chapters add up to a few hundred pages in the print version), so take it easy, maybe divide the work into subsections. Chapter 2 is when the actual grammar lessons start.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.japanesepod101.com/">Japanese Pod 101</a> - A free (mostly) castpod-like teaching Japanese grammar, vocabulary and culture. There is a 1 week free-trial to pdf containing tips and other features, like flashcards with lesson’s vocabulary. Good for storing in your phone and listening while in idle activities, buses, walks, etc. A large collection of lessons can be <a href="https://mega.nz/#F!HhQQVJRY!XGJ6-lTZ-qiaxrkFRqIexg">found here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tanos.co.uk/jlpt/jlpt1/grammar/combined/">JLPT Grammar List</a> - List of all the grammar that you need to know for JLPT 5 to JLPT 1.</p>

<span id="Practice"></span>

<p><h3>Practice</h3></p>

<p><h4><span class="italic">Reading</span></h4></p>

<p><a href="reading list.html">Reading List</a> - This is a list of books, games and manga which we have compiled. You can sort through the list by skill, platform, etc. We recommend you have a look, regardless of skill level. Please contribute anything you read as well to it so it can become a better resource. A particularly detailed summary is not needed.</p>

<p><a href="http://livingjapanese.com/pages/reading_packs.html">Yotsuba Reading Pack</a> - This pack is designed for beginners who have just started reading. This is an accompaniment to the first two volumes of Yotsubato. This includes a vocabulary list and a pre-made Anki deck. Yotsubato! is a manga that is often recommended to beginners. Note that, if you don’t want to do the deck, following along the HTML file is still very helpful for slang.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aozora.gr.jp/">Aozora</a> - This site contains a collection of (mostly) Classic Japanese literature. This site is mainly for advanced readers and not recommended for beginners. <a href="http://oshiete.goo.ne.jp/qa/1049335.html">Here’s</a> some good recommendations of famous Japanese authors.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Note to Kindle users:</span> A kind anon put together a guide on how to convert Aozora Bunko text files into the mobi ebook format, as well as a guide on how to convert mobi files into searchable AZW3 ebooks:</li>
<li><a href="http://pastebin.com/8cRxRcQu">Aozora Bunko to Mobi</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pastebin.com/qdaYzitJ">Mobi to AZW3</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://tss.asenheim.org/">Asenheim</a> - Another site for playing visual novels. Features older, officially released Visual novels.</p>

<p><h4><span class="italic">Anime & TV</span></h4></p>

<p><a href="http://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2Fjapanese%2F">Kitsunekko</a> - This site has a selection of Japanese subtitles for popular (anime) shows.  The timing often does not match up with most available downloads, but you can try to retime it in a subtitle editing program or just look at it in the editor to compare with what you hear. There is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O24ILleeONJvnu8EFw-kPxo7Roq1pdlL9UZdhytIpz0/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a> with shows and their subtitle delay, please fill in whatever you find out while using Japanese subtitles.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.d-addicts.com/forum/">D-Addicts</a> - This is a great site to find Dorama with subtitles. (Other Asian dramas are also here, fyi)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fengyunlive.com/space/japan.htm">Fengyunzhibo</a> - This site is a good, easy place to watch some TV. It’s a Chinese streaming site, but it has Japanese channels, which are of good quality for streams. Lately it does not seem to be working, though occasionally in the past this would happen and then it would later become accessible again. Regardless a proxy/VPN could be used if necessary. If you know of any similar sites, please make a comment about them.</p>

<p><a href="http://wilsonjj.me/jptv/">Wjj Media Box</a> - Another site for watching Japanese TV</p>

<p><a href="http://mov3.co/">Mov3</a> - A Chinese site like Fengyunzhibo specializing in Japanese TV.</p>

<p><a href="http://moko-reloaded.neocities.org/">Moko Reloaded</a> - A site with 30 Japanese TV channels to stream.</p>

<p><h4><span class="italic">Listening & Production</span></h4></p>

<p><a href="http://lang-8.com/">Lang-8</a> - Here, you can write journal entries which are corrected by Japanese natives, and in return, you correct theirs. This is a great way to increase your writing/production ability and also meet people to talk to.</p>

<p><a href="http://jpopsuki.eu/">Jpopsuki</a> - Great place to get and find any Japanese/Asian music, not just jpop. Requires that you get an account by either applying for one, or by having someone invite you. Sometimes you will be unable might ask for a referral either in the threads or on /mu/. If you do have someone refer you, make sure to keep a good ratio, because failing to do so could cause that person to apply for one, so if you want access, youn to lose their account (as well as yours), since all those you refer are considered to be under your responsibility.</p>

<p><a href="http://skypech.com/">Skypech</a> - Here’s a site for finding some natives on Skype to talk to. This a Japanese site for Japanese people, so do not misunderstand and think that everyone here has an interest in learning English.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/">Niconico</a> - A site with lots of Japanese videos and also a section for streamers if you want to see what a native sounds like. Ideal if you don’t want to actually commit to interacting with another person.</p>

<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/3qH9MgZJ">Radio shows</a> - Radio shows provide a variety of themes and people speaking. But people also speak at a natural or even fast pace. Recommended for advanced listeners or people simply interested in listening to radio.</p>

<p><h4><span class="italic">Other</span></h4></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nyaa.se/">Nyaa</a> - If you type in the Japanese name, you can find the raw version of whatever media you are looking for most of the time. If what you’re looking for is ero, use <a href="http://sukebei.nyaa.se/">this.</a>  Note that most VNs will contain ero, and sometimes even non-ero VNs are uploaded to Sukebei instead of the main site.</p>

<span id="Videos"></span>

<p><h3>Videos</h3></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9987A659670D60E0">Namasensei's Japanese lessons (YouTube)</a> - Covers fairly little material but is a fun and very motivating introduction to the language for people who are just starting out. You bitch.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/lingosteve/videos">Steve Kaufmann (YouTube)</a> - Channel maintained by a Canadian polyglot who knows about a dozen languages and lived in Japan for close to 10 years. Contains lots of useful tips for language learning in general. Some recommended videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqfISgCQV-U">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5IPArDxO40">2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFED4984055236DDE">3</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/freejapaneselessons3/videos">nihongonomori (YouTube)</a> - Channel apparently run by a group of Koreans with a bunch of video lessons on Japanese. Quite a lot of them seem to be related to studying for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test">JLPT</a> exams. According to the anon who suggested the channel "[the] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLINFE8v4DOhtUkvfx3UrJ8CwD9U7xWbZA">Learn Japanese Grammar 1 playlist</a> is ok. It has a better explanation of particles than [Tae Kim's guide], but the stuff on verbs & adjectives are not given enough time."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/learnjapanesebod/videos">LearningJapanese (YouTube)</a> - Most of the videos are break-downs of sentences taken from Chinese Cartoons where the guy explains how all the grammar and vocabulary in the sentence fits together to produce its meaning. There seem to be other videos on the channel where the guy just talks about certain aspects of the language too.</p>

<p><a href="https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=334804">Let's Learn Japanese Basic I</a> / <a href="https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=339735">Basic II</a> - A video series produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Foundation">The Japan Foundation</a>, the first season in the mid-1980s, and the second season 10 years later. Apparently covers similar material to what can be found in Genki and Tae Kim's guide.</p>

<p><h2>Useful Learning Tools</h2></p>

<span id="Typing Japanese"></span>

<p><h3>Typing Japanese</h3></p>

<p><span class="italic">Input Method Editor (IME) - It will allow you to type in Japanese using your keyboard. Required.</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">(Note: Both Mac and Windows have IME’s already pre-installed but it’s not as featureful as Google IME.)</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="https://www.google.co.jp/intl/ja/ime/">Google IME</a> <span class="italic">(Windows, Mac OS)</span> - Google IME generally includes a larger collection of words, inclusive of internet slang. The downside, however, is that its handwriting recognition is rather lacking (see ”sljfaq” below). To switch between romaji and kana press alt+` (just above tab key). Ctrl + Caps Lock for hiragana, hold shift while in hiragana mode to type in katakana. Alt + Caps is katakana. Shift + Caps reverts back to hiragana. This does not affect Caps Lock. You can also press F7 after typing something in hiragana to switch it to katakana without changing mode.
Protip: Type in kaomoji and hit space. Alternatively: read <a href="http://nihonshock.com/2010/04/12-japanese-ime-tips/">this article</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/mozc">Mozc</a> <span class="italic">(Chromium OS, Android, Windows, Mac OS, GNU/Linux)</span> - This is a project that stems from Google IME, except that it is available on a greater number of operating systems.</p>

<p>If you have any trouble with Mozc for GNU/Linux read <a href="http://chris.bracken.jp/2011/10/installing-ibus-mozc-on-ubuntu-1110.html">this</a>.</p>

<p>Packages also exist in Fedora, Debian, GNU/Linux Mint, and. For Arch, it‘s available in the AtwUR.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.localizingjapan.com/blog/2012/05/29/japanese-input-on-ubuntu-linux-12-04-lts-precise-pangolin/">iBus</a> - <span class="italic">(GNU/Linux)</span> - If you use (K/X/L)Ubuntu, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JapaneseInput">you probably already have it</a>. You just need to install the Japanese IME packages using the language support in the settings and select iBus as your keyboard input method system. You can select the keys to press to change the keyboard layout or do it manually using the icon on the panel. For the rest of us that don’t use Ubuntu or its variants, you can probably find iBus in the official repositories of your distribution. You can make iBus autostart when you boot by adding ibus-daemon to your ~/.xinitrc. And you will probably want to add & to the end, ala: ibus-daemon & (also your windows manager might have it’s own autostart file, use that instead) that you can find in your Home folder.</p>

<p><h3>Anki</h3></p>

<p><span class="italic">Flashcard software. Also available for mobile.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> - Anki is a flashcard program which uses a method called spaced repetition to drill information into your head. You can download <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">premade decks</a>. It shows you a set amount of new cards each day (default 20) and will show you the same cards again when you are most likely to forget them, which is predicted through algorithms. This program has a lot of features that can’t be covered here, so <span class="bold">R</span>ead <span class="bold">T</span>he <span class="bold">F</span>ucking <a href="http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html"><span class="bold">M</span>anual</a> if you wish to totally utilize Anki. You can also get this on your mobile device and sync your deck between both versions. The official App Store version costs money (to support the devs) so you might just want to use Safari in that case instead.</p>

<p>There are programs and add-ons that further increase its usefulness, see: <a href="http://rtkwiki.koohii.com/wiki/Morph_Man">Morph Man</a>, <a href="http://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/">subs2srs</a>, and <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/">many more</a>. A popular add-on worth mentioning is <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/942570791">Kanji Grid</a>, which allows you to visualise your progress through the kanji and may help to keep you motivated in your struggle with them.</p>

<p>If you use GNU/Linux and you want to change the size of the Japanese characters, you need to install the appropriate Japanese fonts, if you don’t have them. Two high-quality fonts which should be available in the repositories of most distros are the IPA Gothic & Mincho fonts developed by Japan’s Information-technology Promotion Agency (the package in your distro’s repo should come with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface#Proportion">proportional</a> variants, IPAPGothic and IPAPMincho respectively, which have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning">kerning</a> and thus should be more visually-pleasing), and the Noto CJK fonts developed by Google (note that the latin glyphs in the Noto CJK font are different from those in the ordinary Noto font). Even Windows users should consider switching to these fonts as Microsoft’s own Gothic and Mincho fonts are quite poor. For more fonts, see <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/ep3797/japanese_fonts.html">this</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/ep3797/modified_fonts_01.html">this</a>.</p>

<p>Anki is highly customizable, and you may change whatever you see fit to match your learning style, but for a quick start into learning vocabulary with Anki, the procedure in <a href="anki.html">DJT’s Anki start-up guide</a> is recommended.</p>

<p><a href="http://core6000.neocities.org/">Core6K/10K/5K index</a> - This site lets you browse the contents of various popular Anki decks online.</p>
