<h2 id="Learning Resources">Learning Resources</h2>

<h3 id="Kana">Kana</h3>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="kana/index.html">DJT Kana</a> - Tests kana recognition. The recommended procedure for learning kana. Just grind until you know them. Optimal for pounding the readings into your head quickly.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Hiragana/Lesson_1">Wikibooks</a> - Has stroke order and other resources. The stroke order is quite useful, although the mnemonics are not so much.</p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/writing">Tae Kim</a> - This site has a ton on kana, includes a video lesson, stroke order, as well as a pronunciation guide.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a> - Offers various SRS courses including kana courses which are perhaps the only thing the site does well in regards to the Japanese language.</p>

<p><a href="https://mega.nz/#F!Wk8VjJ6K!icqt2OiW4Vhle7q4cGUf_Q">Remembering the Kana</a> - It only takes about 6 hours to learn both hiragana and katakana alongside it because it provides mental images with the kana to ensure you remember. Download the book and/or follow this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2A25F7399E8805ED">video series</a> made by an RTK forum member.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/tukkun/kana-warrior">Kana Warrior</a> - A game designed to help you recognise the kana. Best used alongside another method.</p>

<h3 id="Kanji">Kanji</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi">Remembering the Kanji</a> (RTK) by Heisig - A book that teaches kanji in an order based on the radicals of each character. It starts you off with simple shapes and gradually goes into more complex ones. It teaches stroke order and makes up pretty fancy mnemonic stories to help you memorize the kanji easier. It does not teach the readings until the second volume nor does it tell you how the kanji are used in context. (Most people do not use the second volume and instead learn readings through vocabulary.) As such, this method expects you to learn all the common characters before even getting started on learning vocabulary. Of course, you can still start learning vocabulary while doing Heisig.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/">Koohii</a> is a fansite that provides pre-made stories for RTK, generally superior to the ones in the book. (Note that some people find that creating their own mnemonic story can form stronger associations than trying to memorize someone else’s.) You can access these stories more conveniently from <a href="https://hochanh.github.io/rtk/">this interface</a>. Do not use the spaced-repetition-system on Koohii; Anki is superior. There is an Anki deck in the <a href="cor.html">Cornucopia of Resources</a>. You’ll also need to follow alongside the book PDF, since the deck does not teach the “primitive” kanji components.</li>
<li>Read more about it from <a href="http://rtkwiki.koohii.com/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji">Koohii wiki</a> or <a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/blog/2008/01/31/final-thoughts-on-remembering-the-kanji/">Tae Kim</a>. <a href="https://nihongoshark.com/learn-kanji/">Here</a> is a detailed post about the mnemonic system, its advantages, and how to apply it, as well as how to incorporate Anki into it for added effectiveness (note: while this guy recommends using the kanji on the front of the card in Anki on the basis that it is easier, Heisig says, in all caps no less, in his book that <a href="assets/rtk.png">reviewing should only ever be done from the keyword</a>; the RTK deck in the Cornucopia of Resources has the keyword on the front of the cards, but is otherwise identical to the deck recommended on that page).</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.kanjidamage.com/">KanjiDamage</a> - Another kanji resource that uses a radical-based order. Unlike Heisig’s method it also teaches the readings and gives you examples of common words that use those kanji (great for adding them to your Anki deck right away). Take the introduction on the site with a grain of salt, as it isn’t very accurate, or is just plain wrong, as is the case with some other areas on the site, but that in no way makes this a bad resource in regards to learning. You may want to simply use the shared deck for Anki (see <a href="cor.html">Cornucopia of Resources</a>) instead of the website in tandem with another vocabulary deck in order to build up a big cache of words quickly.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mega.co.nz#!CQg0SKyI!Ufho0RKmmW8P6XRx8KiDY1JeAXoGOgmjrEscayil8cA">KanjiDamage+ (Anki deck)</a> The deck was created to solve some of the problems with KanjiDamage - namely the often criticized style of mnemonics. They're still there but often toned down or changed to something more logical/less crude. Some mistakes are fixed. Furthermore, the kanji base got significantly expanded, now the deck has 2136 cards (~1900 kanji, rest are radicals).  The deck can be browsed online <a href="http://kanjidamageplus.neocities.org/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://mega.nz/#!ncYFXTyJ!KXwmhJu4QogtPasf0wt_zxyGvIfnm4gXxKsmdIv51sQ">The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course</a> - KKLC follows in the RTK tradition but differs in several ways. Like RTK, it uses a mnemonic approach and teaches kanji components step by step. Unlike RTK, it teaches the most common kanji first, teaches their meanings through sample vocabulary rather than in isolation, and includes mnemonics for every kanji. (The RTK book stops providing pre-made mnemonics after the few first hundred kanji, but has a large number of community-made mnemonics available online.) Each entry includes 4 or 5 vocabulary words  to illustrate the kanji's meanings and readings. These words consist only of previously learned kanji, so you can make sense of the words right away, and also get constant review of kanji studied earlier. Use it with an Anki deck such as <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/779483253">this one</a>. The author maintains a website <a href="http://keystojapanese.com/">here</a> with information and supporting tools for KKLC users.</p>

<p><a href="https://mega.nz/#!IAVVlBab!qQazRubQ3VZ_WjjLS4CclxYQF-6QGRtnmwd_zGBZpIo">Kangxi Radicals</a> - An Anki deck with more accurate meanings for the radicals than other available resources. Comes with only recognition-style cards (radical on the front, meaning on the back) by default, but you can change them to recall-style cards (meaning on the front, radical on the back), because the deck disambiguates variants.</p>

<p><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1044119361">Kanji Radical (Primitive)</a> - Contains all 214 radicals, their alternative forms (which may be used more often or even exclusively instead of the 'proper' form), their meaning (which is sometimes related to the kanji they appear in) and their Japanese readings  (which there isn't really any point in learning). Compared to the deck above, this has more information but may be less accurate.  <a href="http://pastebin.com/KibfAzNw">Has both recognition and recall cards</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>You may wish to use <a href="http://pastebin.com/gzKyJXqr">this</a> customised layout which adds a mincho/serif font to the cards so you can see how the radicals look in that typeface. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For rote kanji study</strong>: Just pick whichever mnemonic deck (RTK/KKLC/KD) takes your fancy and edit the card layout to remove the mnemonics if necessary. The reason for this is that the mnemonic decks give much more concise meanings for the kanji, whereas rote decks often have far too many meanings to be realistically remembered for each kanji. It's worth doing <a href="https://mega.nz/#!uJsA1QwR!2z65jNf9lagIjvESUHHE-mMT3EXjfbRiBo91F9RpQwU">a radical deck</a> first so that if you encounter any kanji which you're really struggling to remember through rote, you can make up a mnemonic using the radicals.</p>

<h3 id="Vocabulary">Vocabulary</h3>

<p><span class="bold">Anki Shared Decks</span> - This is highly recommended to learn vocabulary. Obviously, you will need <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> to use it. There are decks, you may search for them and see which one will best suit your needs. The most commonly recommended vocabulary deck is <a href="anki.html">Core 2k/6k</a>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/">Yomichan’s Anki integration</a> - Yomichan has a companion Anki add-on called <a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/#anki-integration">AnkiConnect</a> which allows users to automatically create cards in Anki for the words which they hover over. Unlike with Rikaisama, this is done by clicking a button as opposed to pressing a hotkey.

<!--
<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="http://rikaisama.sourceforge.net/#realtime_import_help">Rikaisama's Anki Real-Time Import Feature</a> - An invaluable tool for creating a mining deck. Allows you to automatically create cards in Anki simply by hovering over a word and pressing "r". <a href="anki.html#import">Here</a> is an explanation of how to set it up. </p>
-->

<h3 id="Grammar">Grammar</h3>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar">Tae Kim</a> - This is the most commonly used guide on DJT because it is faster than the others listed here. Use the grammar guide, not the “complete guide” (which is incomplete). Tae Kim only has exercises in the beginning, after which there are no exercises to work on.</p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="https://mega.nz/#!xdg01AxA!L6rsoZESvl_C8jHyHIwgM7q9BFhr0jIHSPuOR1t8x1k">Japanese the Manga Way</a> - This book teaches grammar through examples from actual Japanese manga, breaking down each sentence into its components to explain the meaning. It covers most of the same material as Tae Kim with less technical language, and will teach you enough grammar to begin reading. </p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="https://mega.co.nz#F!m5tU0QxJ!ML2OBq3waLUHrWg9HiWeSA">Dictionaries of Japanese Grammar (DOJG)</a> - A collection of three books, Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. As the name implies, these are dictionaries rather than guides. It goes in-depth into the various grammar rules, more so than virtually any other resource.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is an index of the DOJG <a href="http://core6000.neocities.org/dojg/">here</a> with notes, example sentences and formation tables.</li>
<li>There is also a <a href="http://dojgdeck.neocities.org/">DOJG Anki deck</a>. Those in favour of it suggest that it is a good way of exposing yourself to all the entries in the DOJG books and periodically reviewing them.
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/w0gRFM0c">Genki</a> - A textbook which has exercises that you can practice, which may help drill grammar rules into your mind. The obvious downside is speed, of course. This resource can be found on the bottom of the pastebin.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/c6219m4xxxixj0x/Genki+1+%28Anon+edit%29.zip">Genki 1</a> - An edited version of Genki 1 with the distracting romaji edited out can be found here. This version is preferred over the one in the pastebin as it encourages the learning of kana.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www2.gwu.edu/~eall/vjgnew/vjghomepage/vjghome.htm">Visualizing Japanese Grammar</a> - A series of videos by a native Japanese linguist who works as a university professor in the US whichthat lucidly explain the basics of Japanese grammar. Each grammar concept has a quiz to test your understanding. Some basic prior knowledge, such as the ability to read kana, is presumed. The videos can also be downloaded from the <a href="cor.html">CoR</a> .</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imabi.net/">Imabi</a> - Written by a guy with a linguistics degree. More factually accurate and comprehensive than Tae Kim's guide, but its length and abundant use of linguistics terminology may make it unsuitable for complete beginners and/or people who would like to just quickly get basic grammar down and move onto reading. Those who plan on doing <a href="anki.html">Core2K</a> before they start reading, however, should have ample time (~3 months) to get through it before they finish that deck. While it has some flaws as a beginner’s guide, it can be very useful as a reference resource, especially for things which aren't covered in Tae Kim's guide.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.japanesepod101.com/">Japanese Pod 101</a> - A free (mostly) castpod-like teaching Japanese grammar, vocabulary and culture. There is a 1 week free-trial to pdf containing tips and other features, like flashcards with lesson’s vocabulary. Good for storing in your phone and listening while in idle activities, buses, walks, etc. A large collection of lessons can be <a href="https://mega.nz/#F!HhQQVJRY!XGJ6-lTZ-qiaxrkFRqIexg">found here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://sakubi.neocities.org/">Sakubi</a> - A guide that aims to be more precise than Tae Kim while using less academic language than Imabi.</p>

<p><a href="https://core6000.neocities.org/hjgp/">A Handbook of Japanese Grammar Patterns for Teachers and Learners</a> (HJGP) - A grammar dictionary similar to the DoJG, but with broader coverage.</p>

<p><a href="http://livingjapanese.com/pages/reading_packs.html">Yotsuba Reading Pack</a> - This pack is designed for beginners who have just started reading. This is an accompaniment to the first two volumes of Yotsubato. This includes a vocabulary list and a pre-made Anki deck. Yotsubato! is a manga that is often recommended to beginners. Note that, if you don’t want to do the deck, following along the HTML file is still very helpful for slang.</p>

	<li><a href="http://sokoani.com/">sokoani (そこ☆あに)</a> - A long-running Japanese podcast about anime. There are over 500 episodes constituting approximately 450 hours (and 10.7 GB) of listening material. Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget">wget</a>, it is possible to automate the process of downloading all the episodes with the following command:<br/>
	<code>wget http://podcast.sokoani.com/SA/mp3/s{001..501}.mp3</code><br/>
	(adjust the 501 number to match whatever the current number of episodes is)<br/>

	<code>wget http://podcast.sokoani.com/SA/mp3/z{001..038}.mp3</code><br/>
	(again, adjust the final number to match the current number of episodes - note that episode 7 is split into two parts so this command will fail to download those; you will need to individually wget z007-1.mp3 and z007-2.mp3 for episode 7)</li>

I estimate that there is somewhere around 700 hours of listening material here. The guests on the podcast are mostly male speakers who speak very quickly, so prepare yourself for a challenge. The best way to download the episodes seems to be from the <a href="http://podcast.1242.com/voice/index.xml">RSS feed</a> with a download manager like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/">DownThemAll</a> (total size of all current episodes is 29.3 GB). Don’t try to wget the URL range like with the sokoani podcast above, else you will end up downloading episodes of every other podcast on the site in the process.</li>

<h3 id="Typing Japanese">Typing Japanese</h3>

<p><span class="italic">Input Method Editor (IME) - It will allow you to type in Japanese using your keyboard. Required.</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">(Note: Both Mac and Windows have IME’s already pre-installed but it’s not as featureful as Google IME.)</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="https://www.google.co.jp/intl/ja/ime/">Google IME</a> <span class="italic">(Windows, Mac OS)</span> - Google IME generally includes a larger collection of words, inclusive of internet slang. The downside, however, is that its handwriting recognition is rather lacking (see ”sljfaq” below). To switch between romaji and kana press alt+` (just above tab key). Ctrl + Caps Lock for hiragana, hold shift while in hiragana mode to type in katakana. Alt + Caps is katakana. Shift + Caps reverts back to hiragana. This does not affect Caps Lock. You can also press F7 after typing something in hiragana to switch it to katakana without changing mode.
Protip: Type in kaomoji and hit space. Alternatively: read <a href="http://nihonshock.com/2010/04/12-japanese-ime-tips/">this article</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/mozc">Mozc</a> <span class="italic">(Chromium OS, Android, Windows, Mac OS, GNU/Linux)</span> - This is a project that stems from Google IME, except that it is available on a greater number of operating systems.</p>

<p>If you have any trouble with Mozc for GNU/Linux read <a href="http://chris.bracken.jp/2011/10/installing-ibus-mozc-on-ubuntu-1110.html">this</a>.</p>

<p>Packages also exist in Fedora, Debian, GNU/Linux Mint, and. For Arch, it‘s available in the AtwUR.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.localizingjapan.com/blog/2012/05/29/japanese-input-on-ubuntu-linux-12-04-lts-precise-pangolin/">iBus</a> - <span class="italic">(GNU/Linux)</span> - If you use (K/X/L)Ubuntu, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JapaneseInput">you probably already have it</a>. You just need to install the Japanese IME packages using the language support in the settings and select iBus as your keyboard input method system. You can select the keys to press to change the keyboard layout or do it manually using the icon on the panel. For the rest of us that don’t use Ubuntu or its variants, you can probably find iBus in the official repositories of your distribution. You can make iBus autostart when you boot by adding ibus-daemon to your ~/.xinitrc. And you will probably want to add & to the end, ala: ibus-daemon & (also your windows manager might have it’s own autostart file, use that instead) that you can find in your Home folder.</p>

<ul>
<li>If IBus doesn’t show up under “Keyboard input method system”, it may not have been installed automatically for some reason when you installed Japanese language support. Try opening a terminal and manually installing either ibus-mozc or ibus-anthy, and IBus should then appear as an option.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to configure Qt for input in Qt apps. See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IBus#Initial_setup">this</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ibus#Plasma_5">this</a>.</li>
<li>For problems with other applications, see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IBus#Troubleshooting">this</a>.</li>

<h3 id="Anki">Anki</h3>

<p><span class="italic">Flashcard software. Also available for mobile.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> - Anki is a flashcard program which uses a method called spaced repetition to drill information into your head. It shows you a set amount of new cards each day (default 20) and will show you the same cards again when you are most likely to forget them, which is predicted through algorithms. This program has a lot of features that can’t be covered here, so <span class="bold">R</span>ead <span class="bold">T</span>he <span class="bold">F</span>ucking <a href="http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html"><span class="bold">M</span>anual</a> if you wish to totally utilize Anki. You can also get this on your mobile device and sync your deck between both versions. The official App Store version costs money (to support the devs) so you might just want to use Safari in that case instead.</p>

<p>There are programs and add-ons that further increase its usefulness, see: <a href="http://rtkwiki.koohii.com/wiki/Morph_Man">Morph Man</a>, <a href="http://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/">subs2srs</a>, and <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/">many more</a>. A popular add-on is <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/942570791">Kanji Grid</a>, which allows you to visualise your progress through the kanji and may help to keep you motivated in your struggle with them.</p>

<p>If you use GNU/Linux and you want to change the size of the Japanese characters, you need to install the appropriate Japanese fonts, if you don’t have them. Two high-quality fonts which should be available in the repositories of most distros are the IPA Gothic & Mincho fonts developed by Japan’s Information-technology Promotion Agency (the package in your distro’s repo should come with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface#Proportion">proportional</a> variants, IPAPGothic and IPAPMincho respectively, which have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning">kerning</a> and thus should be more visually-pleasing), and the Noto CJK fonts developed by Google (note that the latin glyphs in the Noto CJK font are different from those in the ordinary Noto font). Even Windows users should consider switching to these fonts as Microsoft’s own Gothic and Mincho fonts are quite poor. For more fonts, see the <a href="cor.html#fonts">CoR</a>.</p>

<p>Anki is highly customizable, and you may change whatever you see fit to match your learning style, but for a quick start into learning vocabulary with Anki, the procedure in <a href="anki.html">DJT’s Anki start-up guide</a> is recommended.</p>

<p><a href="http://core6000.neocities.org/">Core6K/10K/5K index</a> - This site lets you browse the contents of various popular Anki decks online.</p>

<h3 id="Dictionaries">Dictionaries</h3>

<p><span class="italic">Use these to look up words. Jisho and Tangorin also have kanji lookup.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="">Yomichan</a> - <em>(Firefox & Chrome)</em> - A browser add-on like Rikaisama which allows the user to hover over words in order to see their meanings. By default, its behaviour is quite different from Rikaisama’s, though it can be configured to behave in a similar manner by disabling the “Middle mouse button scans” option and setting the “Scan modifier key” to “None” (it is recommended if you do this to set the “Popup offset” option to either 0 or 1, else it will become very difficult to mouse into the popup before it automatically disappears). After installation, you need to import JMDict in Yomichan's settings by clicking the arrow next to the input box under the "Dictionaries" section. Has a companion Anki add-on called <a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/#anki-integration">AnkiConnect</a> which allows users to automatically add words they hover over to their Anki deck.

<p><a href="http://rikaisama.sourceforge.net/">Rikaisama</a> - <span class="italic">(Firefox)</span> - This is a tool that shows you equivalent or close meanings (in English) of Japanese words in plaintext format, by hovering over them. Has many useful features such as audio playback and the ability to save words to a file or import it straight into Anki. <strong>Note: Rikaisama is abandonware and will no longer work in Firefox versions 57 and onwards.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There is also Rikaichan for Firefox, but there is absolutely no reason to use it since Rikaisama has all of its features.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaicake-jp-en-dictionary/">RikaiCake</a>: This is a dictionary file that adds 5,000 additional definitions, curated by a manga translator.

<p><span class="bold">※</span><a href="http://jisho.org/">Jisho</a> - Online J>E/E>J dictionary. It also contains information on kanji including a order, readings, etc. You can also search a kanji by handwriting or its radicals if you don’t know the correct stroke order. </p>

<p><a href="http://tangorin.com/">Tangorin</a> - Another online dictionary with information on kanji and vocabulary.

<p><a href="http://www.jedict.com/">JEdict</a> - An offline dictionary application. Contains various dictionaries (you can download and add more) and handwritten Kanji lookup. It seems that it’s only available for Mac.</p>
